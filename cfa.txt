Practical 1: Creating a Forensic Image Using FTK Imager
Theory: FTK Imager is a widely-used forensic tool for creating forensic images, verifying data integrity, and analyzing files. It supports capturing volatile memory and is essential for examining digital evidence in forensics investigations.

Steps:

1. Open FTK Imager.
2. Go to File > Create Disk Image.
3. Select the source as Content of the Folder, then provide necessary permissions.
4. Browse and select the file for imaging.
5. Add a destination to save the image.
6. Enter the necessary evidence information.
7. Choose the destination folder and filename for the image.
8. Start the image creation process.
9. Once completed, add the evidence item and select the created .ad1 file to analyze.
10.Access files from the Evidence Tree pane.

Practical 7: Email Forensics Using FTK
Theory: Email forensics involves analyzing email headers and content to trace suspicious emails and detect forgery. FTK provides capabilities for inspecting deleted emails and analyzing mailboxes.

Steps:

1. Install and open FTK.
2. Start a new case and add the email data source.
3. Analyze deleted and inbox emails using the Email tab.
4. Export email evidence and generate a report.

Practical 8: Web Browser Forensics
Theory: Web browser forensics involves extracting and analyzing browser artifacts such as history, cache, cookies, and download records to reconstruct user browsing behavior. This is useful for tracking suspicious online activities.

Steps:

1. Install and run Browser History Examiner.
2. Capture browsing history from the local computer.
3. Analyze saved browser data, including history and cookies.
